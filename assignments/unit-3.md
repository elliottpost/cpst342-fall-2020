# Unit 3 Assignment

## Overview
For this assignment, you will updating your WordPress theme to have several JavaScript interactions. Note that you do not need to complete _all_ requirements. See rubric below.

Your website will need to be uploaded to Pantheon and deployed to the `test` environment. 

## Requirements

1. Your website uses AJAX to fetch _and_ display data either from WordPress or from another resource (can be anything with a publicly accessible API, including social media)
1. Using JavaScript, your website interacts with the DOM in some way. This can be handled by completing step 1 above
1. Your JavaScript uses ES6 syntax (no `var` declarations)
1. You use local and/or session storage
1. Your website uses event handling in some way. This can be a form submission interception to validate forms, submitting the form itself, recognizing a click on something to modify the DOM or do something else...

### Special Requirement (must fulfill for ALL submissions)
1. State where in your source code I can find the code that does these interactions
1. State where in your website I can test/find the interactions (provide links and instructions)

## Submission
Submit the team member names (up to 2) who worked on this project together and the site URL that I should review. I will pull-down your source code from Pantheon to check that so you do not need to submit any code via Sakai.

You can submit the special requirement as an attachment or inline text on the submission itself.

## Grading and Rubric

This assignment is due at the end of Unit 3. It is worth 100 points.
