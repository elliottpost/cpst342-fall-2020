# Final Project 

## Overview
For your final project, you will do one of the following items:
 
1. Creating 1 custom Gutenberg component for WordPress using JSX.
1. Creating a custom page builder for WordPress using ACF (must support at least 3 components)
1. Create a static website that uses JavaScript to query from WP JSON (REST API) instead of using PHP to render site content (must support home page, single page, blog archive, single blog post). You can use basic AJAX or you can build a fully statically generated site depending on how easy/hard you want to make this.

Details will provided more in-class on each of these, but they are all "real life" examples you would have to build if you are working as a developer on a WordPress website. 

## Rubric

Rubric will be made available later in the semester

## Proposal

Of the 3 project choices above, state your top number one and number two choices and _why_ you feel that way. If working as a group, only one submit one response, but your answers should be formatted as a group response and not a single person deciding for the team. I am asking for two choices in case I feel that your top choice might not be the right choice for you/your team based on your programming experience.

If you choose option 1 (Creating 1 custom Gutenberg component for WordPress using JSX), give a few ideas on what the component will be. You'll need to ensure it allows users to enter and save at least 3 fields into the WordPress admin and displays appropriately on the front-end. You'll also have to develop the HTML for it, of course. 

Submit your written proposal via Sakai.
