### Course Description
	
This course studies the concepts, methods, and tools used in the analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment of typical multi-tier web applications. Specific topics include presentations, business, and data access layers, as well as integration with database systems. An introduction to web page development using JavaScript, jQuery and associated client-side tools.   

### Learning Outcomes

Experience with commonly used web application development frameworks. Familiarity with database integration and deployment environments. Create webpages using JavaScript and related tools and protocols, and interface a webpage with a database.  


# Special Course Requirements

* This course is programming intensive. Lab sessions will be held during class periods. 
* The course uses Sakai to organize materials. You will generally submit your assignments using Sakai. Ask for help if you are not familiar with Sakai.  


### Technology Requirements / Course Tools
This course will utilize several technologies for coursework and communication. All students are expected to have access to a working computer (NOT a tablet!) for online sessions (or use of the computer lab if attending in-person). The full list of technologies used is below:  

* [Sakai](http://sakai.luc.edu) for the course gradebook and homework submission.   
* [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for streaming online sessions. The link given is for the support site. Actual lessons will be accessed through Sakai. 
* [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com) A note taking & distribution tool. Strictly speaking, you do not need to use this; however, all class notes are provided by the instructor and are available online via OneNote. Your Loyola account has access to this, and you can access OneNote via <https://outlook.luc.edu> and choosing "OneNote" from the menu in the top left once you have signed into Outlook.
* A text-editor or an integrated development environment (IDE). Note that a text-editor is *NOT* a word processor like _Microsoft Word_. For IDEs, I recommend [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). Most class demos will be done using WebStorm. You can get an academic license at <https://www.jetbrains.com/student/>. For text-editors, I recommend [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
* [Piazza](https://piazza.com) A course discussion and Q&A tool. Learn more at <https://www.luc.edu/its/itrs/teachingwithtechnology/piazza/>
  
During the first week we will discuss course software. Additionally, each tool is explained further below:   

#### Sakai
Sakai is Loyolaâ€™s online system for managing courses. The course syllabus, gradebook, and usually course content can be found here. Additionally, forums are available to assist and get assistance from other students on assignments and course software. Get help with Sakai at [Loyola's official support site](http://loyola.screenstepslive.com/s/17190?).  
  
See the communication policy below for further details on student and instructor expectations.  

#### Zoom
Zoom is a video conferencing application similar to Adobe Connect. Learn more at [Zoom.us](https://zoom.us) and see Loyola support site at <http://www.luc.edu/itrs/teachingwithtechnology/zoom/>.   

#### Text-Editors & IDEs
Students are welcome to use their favorite IDE or text-editor if they have one (see next section); however, I recommend WebStorm for this course. 

For many "real-life" Java applications, I would recommend an IDE; however, because the applications created in this course are on a much smaller and less advanced scale, a text-editor more than suffices if you wish.  

Advantages to using an IDE:

 * Code-completion
 * Better error reporting
 * Run applications from within the editor

Disadvantages to using an IDE:

 * Confusing layouts
 * Slower, more memory consumption
 * More advanced options means more complex use

Advantages to using a text-editor

 * Fast, light memory footprint 
 * Simple layout
 * Fully extendable--add plugins as you need

Disadvantages to using a text-editor

 * Lacks good code autocomplete
 * Poor error reporting
 * Must (generally) run programs within the command prompt/terminal

There are many options available for either case and I will not dictate which to use. I will provide support for students using Sublime or WebStorm on Windows, Mac, or Linux. 

#### General
Students are required to have a working computer or laptop that they can install software. A tablet will not suffice for this course. Students are required to have internet access. Students using Loyola's lab computers will not need to install any additional software.  


### Communication, Sessions, & Responsibilities
Piazza & Zoom will be used as the primary means of communication.  


#### Student Communication Policy & Responsibilities
Students are expected adhere to the syllabus and all relevant Loyola academic policies. Students are requested to use Sakai for all course communication. All students are welcome to ask questions and share suggestions and _hints_ to solutions (not the entire solution itself!) in Piazza. Sharing significant portions of the solutions or sharing any code outside of Piazza will be considered cheating.  

Students will not share source-code with anyone other than assignment/project partners and the course instructor, with exceptions noted above.    

#### Sessions & Attendance
This **synchronous** course meets every Wednesday from 6p-9p online through Zoom. Recorded sessions will be made available shortly after the session is held. Attendance is taken every class. Students are allowed one miss without penalty, as the gradebook will automatically drop your lowest participation grade.


#### Labs
Interactive labs will be held-in class (through Zoom). Labs are counted towards participation and will graded on student engagement during lab sessions. **You will generally not be asked to submit anything during lab. If a submission is required, it will be explicitly stated so during lab.** Some weeks will have more than one lab, and other weeks may not have any. Live-coding demos will be done most weeks to supplement the presentations.  

### Group Work

All course assignments, unless specifically stated otherwise, may be done with another person ("Pair Programming"). Students are encouraged to work with a partner, but may choose to work alone if they prefer.

**Each student must complete readings/challenges via ZyBooks, but only one student per team must submit an assignment via Sakai. A team assignment MUST have all student names BEFORE submission for team members to receive credit.**
 

### Tentative Course Schedule
Consult Sakai calendar and ZyBooks for detailed breakdowns and due dates. A general overview can be found below. This is tentative and may be modified during the course depending on how well students are navigating the material. Additional readings may be assigned in class during lecture or as part of an assignment.

### Grading
The grades are weighted as:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Item</th>
            <th>Weight</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>   
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Class Attendance/Participation</td>
            <td>10%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ZyBooks Readings & Challenge Activities</td>
            <td>25%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ZyBooks Labs</td>
            <td>25%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Assignments</td>
            <td>20%</td>
        </tr>      
        <tr>
            <td>Final Project & Presentation</td>
            <td>20%</td>
        </tr>       
    </tbody>
</table>

### Late Policy
All assignments must be turned in via Sakai by 11:55pm of the date due. Late assignments will be accepted for up to three days after the deadline, with each late day leading to a 10% deduction from the assignment grade. Assignments more than three days late will not be accepted without instructor approval. **No extensions will be granted for readings or challenge activities. Complete by the due date for credit.**  

### Academic Integrity
No developer ever truly creates applications entirely from scratch. We all, at one time or another, need help with our code, and the most successful developers frequently seek help from their peers or from the many discussion forums and development guides that can be found online.

That said, all students are expected to write all their own code. When using online sources for help, it is expected that students will first read and understand the material, close the website in questions, and recreate the solution on their own. Copying any amount of code directly from outside sources (including books, online sources, or other students) will be considered plagiarism and will be treated according to [Loyola's Academic Integrity Policy](http://www.luc.edu/academics/catalog/undergrad/reg_academicintegrity.shtml). 

Failure to comply with any of the academic integrity policies will earn a grade of 0 on the assignment, and depending on the severity, the course entirely. The Office of the Dean will also be notified.

### Addendum
There is an addendum to this syllabus on Sakai that discusses further Academic Integrity, Privacy Policy, the Grade Scale, and a number of other legal and ethical obligations. Please be sure to read fully this addendum found under the syllabus link in Sakai.
